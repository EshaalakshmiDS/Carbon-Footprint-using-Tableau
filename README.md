## Description
The "Carbon Footprint Analysis with Tableau" project is a data visualization initiative aimed at highlighting the countries with the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita. This project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create an interactive dashboard that presents CO2 emissions data in an accessible and informative manner.

By analyzing and visualizing emissions data on a per capita basis, we can identify countries that have a disproportionately high carbon footprint compared to their population size. This project aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of different regions and foster discussions on sustainable practices and policies.
